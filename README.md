# CPU-scheduling-algorithm-simulator
Developed a program implementing various CPU scheduling methodologies in C++ to optimize task execution.
The implementation utilizes queues and priority queues. FCFS processes tasks in arrival order; SPN and SRT prioritize
shorter burst times; HRRN uses response ratios; and RR applies adjustable time quanta for fair CPU sharing.
These algorithms are essential for optimizing task scheduling, minimizing wait times, and maximizing CPU efficiency.
